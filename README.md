Heroku Scheduler in Angular 2
======

This project is for a job interview coding challenge. The intent is to mimic
the heroku job scheduler add on. It focuses on the high level UX and omits much
of the finer detail. FWIW its also my first time using Angular 2 and typescript
so I'm probably doing some silly stuff.

Running the project
-----------------
    npm install
    npm run go
